# Keeta Integration Repository

This repository is a clone of the working Base DEX, created to safely develop and integrate Keeta network support without affecting the production Base deployment.

## Repository Structure

We now have two repositories:

### 1. **Original Repo** (Production Base DEX)
- **Location**: `/home/taylo/dex`
- **GitHub**: `git@github.com:NobleSOL/dex.git`
- **Status**: Frozen, production-ready Base DEX
- **Deployment**: Vercel (live at silverbackdefi.app)
- **Purpose**: Stable Base-only DEX, stays untouched

### 2. **New Repo** (Keeta Integration)
- **Location**: `/home/taylo/silverback-multichain`
- **GitHub**: `git@github.com:NobleSOL/keeta.git`
- **Status**: Development - will add Keeta support
- **Purpose**: Safe environment to build multi-chain support

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Add Keeta Support (Current)
1. Keep Base functionality working 100%
2. Add Keeta network configuration
3. Implement network switching UI
4. Test thoroughly with both networks

### Phase 2: Testing
1. Local testing with both Base and Keeta
2. Deploy to separate Vercel preview
3. Full integration testing
4. Performance testing

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. When fully tested and working
2. Point production Vercel to this new repo
3. Old repo becomes backup/archive

## Why This Approach?

**Lessons learned from this morning:**
- Mixing Keeta integration with production Base DEX caused conflicts
- Had to revert, causing downtime and rework
- This approach eliminates that risk

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero risk to production Base DEX
- ✅ Can develop Keeta at our own pace
- ✅ Full integration testing before going live
- ✅ Old repo is safety net
- ✅ When ready, new repo becomes production

## Current State

- Latest commit: `412a8ef` - "Fix header connect wallet button to auto-prompt wallet"
- All recent fixes included:
  - APY calculation fix (10.95% instead of 109.5%)
  - Basescan links on pool cards
  - Auto-prompt wallet connection
  - Official Base RPC endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Add Keeta network configuration
2. Implement network switching in header
3. Add Keeta pool support
4. Test locally with both networks
5. Deploy preview when ready

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** merge changes back to old repo
- **DO NOT** delete old repo until new one is live
- All new work happens in this repo from now on
- When this goes live, it becomes the new main repo
